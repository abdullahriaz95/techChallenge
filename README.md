A kind of tiktok clone.

## Getting Started

This project has its videos uploaded to firebase storage, and gets data from firebase cloud firestore of those videos. It then displays each videos in a carousal style way. The app also includes 4 different categories i.e. Footabll, Music, Funny, Animals. When ever a new category is clicked, and after swipe, the next video is played of the selected category. It uses Mobx as a state management mechanism.
It is tested on Android Device for now.
